# Numerical Methods

Here you can find some implementations of various numerical methods, in C++ and matlab/octave.  
Î‘ coherent format is preserved, in order to perform some basic comparison between the methods.

* Picard method [x=g(x)]
* Newton-Raphson method
* Newton method for simultaneous equations
* Picard method for simultaneous equations
* Gauss-Seidel method
* Power method
* Simpson method (numerical integration)  
* Runge-Kutta method - 2nd & 4th order (ODE evaluation)
* Runge-Kutta method - Stability study
* Shooting method with Runge-Kutta method (Boundary conditions problems)
* Liebmann method (2nd order eliptic PDEs)

For more information you can refer to "Numerical_Methods_report.pdf" at the current directory.

More specifically, these are some exercises submited for the elective course "Numerical Analysis"  
by prof. Nikolaos Stergioulas | Aristotle University of Thessaloniki | Physics department.
