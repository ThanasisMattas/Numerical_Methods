# Numerical Methods

Here you can find some C++ implementations of various numerical methods. Î‘ coherent format is preserved,  
in order to perform some basic comparison between the methods.

* Picard method [x=g(x)]
* Newton-Raphson method
* Newton method for simultaneous equations
* Picard method for simultaneous equations
* Gauss-Seidel method
* Power method

For more information you can refer to "Numerical_Methods_report.pdf" at the current directory.

More specifically, these are some exercises submited for the elective course "Numerical Analysis" by prof. Nikolaos  
Stergioulas | Aristotle University of Thessaloniki | Physics department.
