# Numerical Methods

Here you can find some implementations of various numerical methods, in C++ and
MATLAB. Α coherent format is preserved, in order to perform some basic
comparison between the methods.

* Picard method [x=g(x)]
* Newton-Raphson method
* Newton method for simultaneous equations
* Picard method for simultaneous equations
* Gauss-Seidel method
* Power method
* Simpson method (numerical integration)
* Runge-Kutta method - 2nd & 4th order (ODE evaluation)
* Runge-Kutta method - Stability study
* Shooting method with Runge-Kutta method (Boundary conditions problems)
* Liebmann method (2nd order Elliptic PDEs -- Poisson's function) + SOR scheme
* Lax-Wendroff method (2nd order Hyperbolic PDEs -- Wave function)

If a method performs calculations on a grid, MATLAB is used for matrix
computations.

More specifically, these are some exercises submitted for the elective course
*Numerical Analysis* by prof. Nikolaos Stergioulas, at the Physics department
of *Aristotle University of Thessaloniki*.
