/* Numerical algorithms | Numerical Integration | Simpson method
 *
 * This program uses the Simpson Method to evaluate a given definite integral
 * I (limits: [a, b]). The intention is to compare the interval partitions
 * needed, as opposed with the evaluation by the Filon method, using 5 points.
 * 
 * Simpson method:
 * I = h/2 (f_0 + 4f_1 + 2f_2 + ... + 2f_(n-2) + 4f_(n-1) + f_n)
 * 
 * where h is the discretization step
